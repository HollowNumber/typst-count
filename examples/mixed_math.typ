= Document with Math

This document contains both regular text and mathematical notation.

The quadratic formula is:

$
x = (-b plus.minus sqrt(b^2 - 4a c)) / (2a)
$

This formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$.

Regular text here should be counted, but the inline math and display math should be ignored.
